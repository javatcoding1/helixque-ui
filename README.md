## 🛠️ Local Development

### Frontend Structure (Monorepo)

The frontend is a **Turborepo** workspace managing the Next.js application and shared UI packages.

- **`apps/web`**: Main Next.js application (App Router).
- **`packages/ui`**: Shared UI components (shadcn/ui).

> **Note:** Frontend requires HTTPS in production for getUserMedia to function correctly. Device permissions must be granted by the user.
